# Task: Create a Python File Manager

**Description:**

Your task is to develop a simple file manager in Python. The file manager should have a command-line interface and support basic file and directory management operations such as creating, deleting, moving, copying files and directories, as well as viewing the contents of the current directory.

**Requirements:**

1. Create a new directory.
2. Delete a directory.
3. Move files and directories from one location to another.
4. Copy files and directories.
5. View the contents of the current directory.
6. Navigate between directories.
7. Display the full path of the current directory.
8. Exit the program upon user request.

**Optional Additional Tasks:**

1. Search for files and directories by name.
2. Display information about files and directories, such as size, creation date, last modification date.
3. Support commands to rename files and directories.
4. Protection against accidental deletion of system files or directories.

**Example Usage:**

```
Simple Python File Manager

Current directory: /home/user/documents

1. Create a new directory
2. Delete a directory
3. Move a file/directory
4. Copy a file/directory
5. View the contents of the current directory
6. Navigate to another directory
7. Show the full path of the current directory
8. Exit

Enter the operation number: 
```

**Note:**

This task can be accomplished using the standard Python library for working with files and directories, such as `os`, `shutil`, and `os.path`. You will also need to handle user input and manage the menu in the command line.

Successful completion of this task will require a good understanding of working with files and directories in Python, as well as skills in using functions and conditional statements to handle various operations.
